# Welcome to the RChain Collaborative Learning Community
This github org was created with the intent to organize
groups of people desiring to dive deeper into the foundations of RChain.

[Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rchain-collaborative-learning/join) for group announcements / communication.

## Repositories
The individual repositories roughly correspond to "courses" and each have links to collected materials and recorded sessions.

### [Pi Calculus](https://github.com/RChain-Collaborative-Learning/PiCalculus)
April 2018 - Present: This course records the initial effort of the group to study the Pi Calculus and prepare for the following course:

### [Introduction to the Design of Computational Calculi](https://github.com/RChain-Collaborative-Learning/Introduction-to-the-Design-of-Computational-Calculi)
Set to start late May, the goal of this course led by Greg is to: introduce the Rho Calculus with spacial/location components included, and have the participants be able to design their own computational calculi.
